### TODO:

- [ ] Song metadata

- [ ] Toggles for artist/album/song only search

- [ ] Async song adding to database

- [ ] Gronk player and UI should be seperate like mpd/client. The player should hold state such as the queue, volume and handle the music output.

- [ ] I might want to think about using an mpd server (maybe then replay gain would be easy)

- [ ] Performance profiling(compile dtrace from souce)

- [ ] Global hotkeys (server related things should come first)
