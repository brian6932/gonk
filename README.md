## ‚öíÔ∏è Troubleshooting
> A lot of non-FLAC files fail to play ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø. I'm looking into it.

If somethings goes wrong with the database, you can always delete it here:

| OS            | Path             |
|---------------|------------------|
| Windows       | %appdata%/gronk  |
| Linux & MacOS | ~/.config/gronk/ |

If your music player has broken lines, just increase your zoom level or font size.

## TODO
- [ ] Many files types fail to play correctly

- [x] Song metadata (duration)

- [x] Global hotkeys

- [ ] Allow the user to click on songs in the queue(partialy working)

- [ ] Toggles for artist/album/song only search

- [ ] Gronk player and UI should be seperate like mpd/client. The player should hold state such as the queue, volume and handle the music output.
