## ‚å®Ô∏è Key Bindings

| Move Right  | `L / Right` |
| Volume Up   | `W`         |
| Volume Up   | `S`         |
| Play/Pause  | `Space`     |
| Previous    | `A`         |
| Next        | `D`         |

`1, 2, 3` moves the queue margins forward. `Shift + 1, 2, 3` moves them backwards.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Troubleshooting

If somethings goes wrong with the database, you can always delete it using `gonk reset`.

If your music player has broken lines, increase your zoom level or font size.

## TODO

- [ ] Songs do not play while the volume is 0

- [ ] Configuration file for key bindings

- [x] Fix M4A files 

- [x] Song metadata (duration)

- [x] Global hotkeys

- [ ] Settings menu (output device, music directories)

- [ ] Replay gain support

- [ ] Automatically adjust margin based on viewable songs

- [ ] Automatic updates

- [ ] Icon

- [ ] Allow the user to click on songs in the queue(partialy working)

- [ ] Toggles for artist/album/song only search

- [ ] Gonk player and UI should be seperate like mpd and ncmpcpp. The player should control the queue, volume and output.

> Should the player remember what was in the queue? I like being able to close the player and still listen.
